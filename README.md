# AUC-analysis
Repository containing AUC plotting scripts and calculators. Each of these programs are designed to run using the Anaconda environment for Python 3, so users should first install those packages (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

To make the use of these scripts easier via a command-line, users should also include the locations of scripts to their system `PATH`, allowing the ability to call the scripts from any location on one's computer.

## Repository Organization

The scripts contained in this collection are broken down in to two categories: plotting scripts and calculators. Example data from each category comes from Edwards et al. "Practical Analytical Ultracentrifugation: a guide to the application of fluorescence and absorbance AUC to biological macromolecules" *Submitted*.

## Citing the Scripts in this Repository

If you use any of the following scripts contained within this repository for your research or manuscript preparation, then please cite the following paper(s):

- `svedberg_equation.py`, `multiple_vHW.py`, or `titration_gradient.py` : Edwards et al. "Practical Analytical Ultracentrifugation: a guide to the application of fluorescence and absorbance AUC to biological macromolecules" *Current Protocols in Molecular Biology*, **133**: e131 (2020).
