# AUC-analysis
Repository containing AUC plotting scripts and calculators. Each of these programs are designed to run using the Anaconda environment for Python 3, so users should first install those packages (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

## Repository Organization

The scripts contained in this collection are broken down in to two categories: plotting scripts and calculators. Example data from each category comes from Edwards et al. "Practical Analytical Ultracentrifugation: a guide to the application of fluorescence and absorbance AUC to biological macromolecules" *In preparation*. If you use any of the scripts contained within this repository for your research or manuscript preparation, then please cite that paper.
